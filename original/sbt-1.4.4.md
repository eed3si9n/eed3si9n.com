I'm happy to announce sbt 1.4.4 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.4.4

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt launcher** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

<code>
sbt.version=1.4.4
</code>

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.4.4 is used only for the builds that you want.

### Highlights

- Updates SemanticDB to 4.4.0 to support Scala 2.13.4 [#6148][6148] by [@adpi2][@adpi2]
- Fixes sbt plugin cross building fix [#6091][6091]/[#6151][6151] by [@xuwei-k][@xuwei-k] and [@eatkins][@eatkins]
- Fixes scala-compiler not included into the metabuild classpath [#6146][6146] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]
- Fixes UTF-8 handling in shell and console [#6106][6106] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]
- Fixes macro occasionally dropping expressions trying to work around Scala compiler displaying "a pure expression does nothing" when sbt is really doing something [#6158][6158] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- `Global / localCacheDirectory` for remote caching [#6155][6155] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
