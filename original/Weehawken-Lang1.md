### about Weehawken-Lang

It's a strange time we live in. We can't just meet up and catch up and talk about coding. This also opens an opportunity to think more virtually about the idea of meetups.

I want to start Weehawken-Lang, a virtual meetup group about programming languages and tooling design (compilers, interpreters, build tools etc). It aims to be a casual place where people with different language backgrounds can exchange ideas about programming languages.

We also aim to function as a fundraiser for a good cause. Initially, we plan to donate primarily to April Hyacinth, a contributor to Scala compiler who has been sick for 6 months.

### talk: Equality in Scala

To kick off the event, I ([@eed3si9n](https://twitter.com/eed3si9n)) will give a talk on equality in Scala. Through untangling this one seemingly simple yet complicated concept of `==`, we will trace back the ancestral roots of Scala as a language, and how the design has evolved over the course of its history to achieve its ideals. This first talk is meant to be an ice-breaker to initiate conversations about different language design. The format for future meetings will be determined accordingly.

### talk: TBA

Daniel Spiewak ([@djspiewak](https://twitter.com/djspiewak)) will give a talk!

### chess-timer talk

Inspired by [curry-on](https://www.curry-on.org/2019/), we'll try chess-timer talks.

> Chess-timer talks are our unusual solution to making tech conferences a more interactive, more fun, and better place for learning and discussions.
> 
> Speakers who choose to give a chess-timer talk are allowed 20 minutes of solo speaking time, and 20 minutes of discussion time. A Curry On representative operates a chess-timer during the presentation, switching between solo + discussion time budgets. When an audience member interrupts the talk to ask a question, for example, we switch the timer to deduct from discussion time.
