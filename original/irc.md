## make new channel

To check whether a channel has already been registered, use the command:

    /msg ChanServ info ##channelname

    /join ##channelname

The command to register your channel (once youâ€™ve joined it and you have op status) is as follows:

    /msg ChanServ register ##channelname

## give voice

For freenode,

    /msg ChanServ FLAGS ##channelname Jon +v

The standard way seems to be `/mode ##channelname +v Jon`.

Here's removing the voice

    /msg ChanServ FLAGS ##channelname Jon -v

## give operator rights

For freenode,

    /msg ChanServ FLAGS ##channelname Jon +oO

The standard way seems to be `/mode ##channelname +o Jon`.
