treehugger is a library to write Scala source code programmatically. It's also an implementation of Scala AST based on Reflection API, now available from github [eed3si9n/treehugger](https://github.com/eed3si9n/treehugger).

**Edit:**
I've expanded this into a complete guide using awesome [n8han/pamflet](https://github.com/n8han/pamflet).
