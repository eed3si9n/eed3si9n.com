I made a new Github organization called [foundweekends][foundweekends] for people who like coding in the weekends. If you want to join, or have project ideas ping me on [twitter][1] or come talk to us on [Gitter][2].

As the starter, it will pick up maintenance of [conscript][3], [giter8][4], and [pamflet][5] from [@n8han][n8han].

### conscript 0.5.0

We've already made [the first release][6] today. First, we merged some pending pull requests. Next, I bumped up the Scala, Dispatch, and scopt versions used by conscript [#85][85]. There's been several issues and pull requests around the idea of setup directory, so I've introduced the idea of `CONSCRIPT_HOME`.

If you want to control where conscript downloads things, now you can change it [#86][86].

### cake shop

There was a weekly hacking group in New York a while back. Different members meeting at a grungy cafe called Cake Shop, which played live music at night, but mostly empty in Saturday morning at 11:00. That hacking group was called [Found Weekends][7] (as opposed to feeling lost in the weekend). Projects like Unfiltered have started from this group.
I've only gone to a few of them, but it was one of the first times I met open source developers. I was a bit nervous going there, but felt welcomed once I got there. Just geeks like me writing code. @n8han and @softprops let me join their project when I didn't know anyone else, to which I feel gratitude. That's where the name comes from.

### foundweekends

The immediate motivator for creating the new foundweekends is distributing the maintainance conscript and other tools, but I don't want to limit ourselves to the upkeep of no-longer-maintained projects.
I would also like it to be a place where people can exchange ideas (over Gitter), or pick up things to work on just for a weekend. We'll see how it goes.
