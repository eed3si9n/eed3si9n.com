I'm happy to announce sbt 1.4.3 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.4.3

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt launcher** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>. This installer includes the `sbtn` binary.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

<code>
sbt.version=1.4.3
</code>

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.4.3 is used only for the builds that you want.
