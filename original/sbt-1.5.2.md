I'm happy to announce sbt 1.5.2 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.5.2

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner + launcher** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

<code>
sbt.version=1.5.2
</code>

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.5.2 is used only for the builds that you want.

### Highlights

- Fixes `sbt new` leaving behind `target` directory [#6488][6488] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Fixes `ConcurrentModificationException` while compiling Scala 2.13.4 and Java sources [zinc#974][zinc974] by [@lefou][@lefou]
- Improved [developer guide](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/blob/develop/DEVELOPING.md) for new contributors [#6469][6469] by [@Nirvikalpa108][@Nirvikalpa108]
- Fixes `-client` by making it the same as `--client` [#6500][6500] by [@Nirvikalpa108][@Nirvikalpa108]
- Uses `-Duser.home` instead of `$HOME` to download launcher JAR [#6483][6483] by [@rdesgroppes][@rdesgroppes]
