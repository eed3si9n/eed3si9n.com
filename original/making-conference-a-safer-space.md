### summary

We need to change the culture around tech conferences to improve the inclusion of women (and people from other backgrounds too!). For that, there needs to be clear signaling and communication about two basic issues:

1. No, it's not ok to hit on women at a conference.
2. Assume technical competence, and treat women as professional peers.

These points should be communicated over and over at each conference before the keynote takes place, and before socializing hours.

### retention is the problem

If you've been to a tech conference around Scala, you might notice that overwhelming majority of the speakers and attendees are men. In the recent years, there is more awareness around it, and we are seeing some uptake on female speakers and attendees.

During the [Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.reactivesummit.org/2018/schedule/diversity-and-inclusion-bring-the-thunder) panel in Reactive Summit, Tara Hernandez who is a Senior Engineering Manager at Google said about workspace diversity:

> People complain about the recruitment pipeline, but it's retention that's the issue that causes the problems.

In other words, problem is not finding women: it's about keeping them.

This principle also applies to the Scala community. If we can't retain women (or people from different backgrounds), it's obvious we won't see significant increase over time.

### hey, you're cute..

Unfortunately, in conferences I've gone around the world, I keep hearing about:

- men hitting on women
- men misreading the social cues to think that women are hitting on others (or themselves) when the conversation is completely technical
- men inappropriately touching women without consent
- men assuming women to be a plus-one of other male attendees
- and men undermining technical cachet of women (e.g. assume that they are recruiters)

You might be surprised to find that these things happen in Scala conferences. According to the women I've had chance to talk to, it happens "very frequently" to almost all female tech people. So if you didn't know, it could simply mean that you either don't talk to female programmers or scientists often, or they don't trust you enough. Well, now you know, and you can contribute to fixing this problem.

You might also think, "hey what's the big deal?" Let's see the situation from a female attendee or presenter's point of view here:

She has technical knowledge (just like you), and came to the conference to exchange technical ideas and learn together. She may have spent weeks preparing for a talk etc. She wears a dress like usual. She gets interesting questions, and she's excited to meet new people.
 
- scenario 1: Then comes the social hour with beer or at some bar. Some random dude who's been staying quiet the whole day comes over and says "hey, you're cute.. Do you wanna go somewhere afterwards?"
- scenario 2: She initiates conversations and network with people, just like you. She tries to be friendly and laughs at some jokes. After having a conversation with a dude, he goes "Youâ€™re flirty!" or "Are you trying to recruit me?"

The answer is "no", but your mood is dampened if not ruined. You tell yourself "This was never a safe space. What was I thinking!?" (There are so much more psychological dilemma and tradeoff that goes on for reporting such incident, which I am not going to go into.)

But truthfully, none of this should be female attendees' problem.

### forming a culture

One of the quotes I heard somewhere that I keep coming back to in different contexts is:

> Culture is the patterns of behaviours that are encouraged, discouraged and tolerated by people and systems over time.
>
> [Walking the talk](https://www.walkingthetalk.com/culture-framework/#cultureDefined)

This means that a culture is not only a collection of things we encourage each other ("be kind" etc), but it's also about something we should never do.

If we collectively want to improve women's inclusion in tech conferences, I think the first step we should take is to say "no" together, and codify it as a system.

You might be thinking "seriously, I would never hit on anyone at a conference," but that's besides the point. What we need to do is move the entire bell curve forward and make sure _everyone_ understands it. That includes people who are new to technical conference scene, or open source culture.

### ScalaMatsuri code of conduct

Inspired by reports of harassments, [I proposed back in 2015](http://eed3si9n.com/scalamatsuri-as-a-lifestyle) to adopt stricter policy on making advancements at ScalaMatsuri and any related events, and it was accepted by other organizers.

Here's the first example of "harassment" in [ScalaMatsuri 2019 CoC](https://2019.scalamatsuri.org/en/code-of-conduct/): 

> Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
>
> - Asking other participants out (comments about appearance, romantic or sexual interest) or inappropriate physical contact.

As many Feminism-Wiki-derived Code of Conduct, it starts with "All communication is expected to be appropriate for a technology conference with professional audience including people of many different backgrounds," which is probably the most important line. I am also happy to report that both [Reactive Summit](https://www.reactivesummit.org/code-of-conduct) and [Scala Days](https://na.scaladays.org/code-of-conduct) currently adopt ScalaMatsuri style CoC.

### prevention over enforcement

Making this a rule is a good start, but that's not going to do much on its own. The rules come to life when it becomes part of the education process. Drawing inspiration from stylish [Virgin Atlantic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlKXhL4mlMY) and Virgin America's security videos, I bought up the idea of making a video introducing the CoC. An artist with ScalaMatsuri staff wrote up the storyboard, and CoC video was produced professionally:

See [Code-of-Conduct video at ScalaMatsuri 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfOQNTWdxI).

During the character design, we avoided obvious villain-looking stereotypes like monsters, germs, and big bully types. We intended to infuse the idea that we all harbor the seeds of prejudice, and often the majority group is unaware of how the other side might feel.

There's a plot in the video where Mr. Cat tries to pick up women and take pictures together. Referee whistles with red flag, and Miss Bunny explains that picking people up at the conference is forbidden.

We should think of this as explaining air travellers that the seat needs to be kept upright position during the takeoff. This is explained before the takeoff every single time by the airliner. If you've flown before, this information should be a common sense, but it's still explained every time in case there are someone new. If you actually fly frequently, you should know that some percent of people actually _do not_ keep their seat upright, and flight attendant must tell them. One in twenty, maybe?

It might be counter-intuitive, but it's important _not_ to vilify the majority group (male in this case) since doing so would making them more defensive. Just as we don't kick people out of the plane immediately for not keeping the seat upright, we need consistent and firm messaging, but without burning them at the stake.

### conference organizers

Here are some work-in-progress tips for conference organizers.

Include the two basic rules into Code of Conduct:

1. No, it's not ok to hit on women at a conference.
2. Assume technical competence, and treat women as professional peers.

- Clearly communicate this policy first thing in the morning and right before the social hour.
- Develop a protocol to handle harassment reports. List female staff member as a contact. It takes a lot of courage to report a harassment, so please take each report seriously. Do not deflect the report by making excuses ("maybe he was drunk").
- Reach out to other conference organizers. Learn about what strategies they've applied for increasing diversity at conferences and for making conferences a safe environment for all attendees.

### sponsors, speakers, attendees

If you're a sponsor, a speaker, or an attendee of a technical conference, you should ask the organizer to clearly communicate its policy on making advances. If asked, lobby for banning to make advances. Let's say "no" together so we can build a professional space for women to participate in our conferences as fellow programming nerds.

If you think someone looks attractive, please don't verbalize it. Talk about JSON parsing, category theory, autonomous driving, or cryptocurrency instead.
