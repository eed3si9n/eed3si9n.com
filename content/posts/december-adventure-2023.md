Inspired by [d6](http://plastic-idolatry.com/erik/2023/dec/) and [the original](https://eli.li/december-adventure), I'm going to try to work on something small everyday. I'll post on [Mastodon as well](https://elk.zone/mastodon.social/@eed3si9n/111511724828068883).

my goal: work on sbt 2.x, other open source like sbt 1.x and plugins, or some post on this site, like music or recipe.

I drove 5 hours with immunologists across new england. released my 5h mixtape, which I used to reprogram them. [hyperparameter optimization (2023.12 mixtape)](/2023.12-mixtape). worked on scalaxb at night.

#### 2023-12-02

released [scalaxb 1.12.0](https://scalaxb.org/scalaxb-1.12.0), an XML databinding for Scala. scalaxb 1.12.0 features scalaxbJaxbPackage option to use Jakarta, contributed by Matt Dziuban, and the code gen cross compiled to Scala 3, contributed by Kenji Yoshida. Besides releasing and organizing release notes, the behind the scenes work I did today was updating the tests in Maven plugin so it builds using Scala 2.12 stuff.
