I'm happy to announce sbt 1.7.3 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.7.3

See [1.7.0 release note](/sbt-1.7.0) for the details on 1.7.x features.

### Highlights

- Updates underlying Coursier from 2.1.0-M2 to 2.1.0-M7-18-g67daad6a9 (lm-coursier-shaded 2.0.12) by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner + launcher** from `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.7.3
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.7.3 is used only for the builds that you want.
