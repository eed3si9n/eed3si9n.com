Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I am happy to announce sbt 1.9.0. This is the nineth feature release of sbt 1.x, a binary compatible release focusing on new features. sbt 1.x is released under Semantic Versioning, and the plugins are expected to work throughout the 1.x series. Please try it out, and report any issues you might come across.

The headline features of sbt 1.9.0 are:

- POM consistency of sbt plugin publishing
- `sbt new`, a text-based adventure
- `releaseNotesURL` setting
- Deprecation of `IntegrationTest` configuration

<!--more-->

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.0> to upgrade the `sbt` shell script and the launcher:

```bash
$ sdk install sbt 1.9.0
```

The sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.9.0
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.9.0 is used only for the builds that you want.

### Deprecation of IntegrationTest configuration

sbt 1.9.0 deprecates `IntegrationTest` configuration. ([RFC-3](/sbt-drop-custom-config/) proposes to deprecate general use of configuration axis beyond `Compile` and `Test`, and this is the first installment of the change.)

The recommended migration path is to create a subproject named "integration", or "foo-integration" etc.

```scala
lazy val integration = (project in file("integration"))
  .dependsOn(core) // your current subproject
  .settings(
    publish / skip := true,
    // test dependencies
    libraryDependencies += something % Test,
  )
```

From the shell you can run:

```scala
> integration/test
```

Assuming these are slow tests compared to the regular tests, I might not aggregate them at all from other subprojects, and maybe only run it on CI, but it's up to you.

Why deprecate `IntegrationTest`? `IntegrationTest` was a demoware for the idea of custom configuration axis, and now that we are planning to deprecate the mechanism to simplify sbt, we wanted to stop advertising it. We won't remove it during sbt 1.x series, but deprecation signals the non-recommendation status.

### Changes with compatibility implications

- Deprecates `IntegrationTest` configuration by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]. See above.
- Updates underlying Coursier to 2.1.2 by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n].

### POM consistency of sbt plugin publishing

sbt 1.9.0 publishes sbt plugin to Maven repository in a POM-consistent way. sbt has been publishing POM file of sbt plugins as `sbt-something-1.2.3.pom` even though the artifact URL is suffixed as `sbt-something_2.12_1.0`. This allowed "sbt-something" to be registered by Maven Central, allowing [search](https://central.sonatype.com/search?smo=true&q=sbt-pgp). However, as more plugins moved to Maven Central, it was considered that keeping POM consisntency rule was more important, especially for corporate repositories to proxy them.

sbt 1.9.0 will publish using both the conventional POM-inconsistent style and POM-consistent style so prior sbt releases can still consume the plugin. However, this can be opted-out using `sbtPluginPublishLegacyMavenStyle` setting.

This fix was contributed by Adrien Piquerez ([@adpi2][@adpi2]) at Scala Center in [coursier#2633][coursier2633], [sbt#7096][7096] etc. Special thanks to William Narmontas ([@ScalaWilliam][@ScalaWilliam]) and Wudong Liu ([@wudong][@wudong]) whose experimental plugin [sbt-vspp](https://github.com/esbeetee/sbt-vspp) paved the way for this feature.

### `sbt new`, a text-based adventure

sbt 1.9.0 adds text-based menu when `sbt new` or `sbt init` is called without arguments:

```
$ sbt -Dsbt.version=1.9.0 init
....

Welcome to sbt new!
Here are some templates to get started:
 a) scala/toolkit.local               - Scala Toolkit (beta) by Scala Center and VirtusLab
 b) typelevel/toolkit.local           - Toolkit to start building Typelevel apps
 c) sbt/cross-platform.local          - A cross-JVM/JS/Native project
 d) scala/scala-seed.g8               - Scala 2 seed template
 e) playframework/play-scala-seed.g8  - A Play project in Scala
 f) playframework/play-java-seed.g8   - A Play project in Java
 g) scala-js/vite.g8                  - A Scala.JS + Vite project
 i) holdenk/sparkProjectTemplate.g8   - A Scala Spark project
 m) spotify/scio.g8                   - A Scio project
 n) disneystreaming/smithy4s.g8       - A Smithy4s project
 q) quit
Select a template (default: a):
```

Unlike Giter8, `.local` template creates `build.sbt` etc in the **current directory**, and reboots into an sbt session.

This was contributed by Eugene Yokota ([@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]) in [#7228][7228].

### Towards actionable diagnostics

sbt 1.9.0 adds `actions` field to `Problem` datatype, allowing the compiler to suggest code edits as part of the compiler warnings and errors in a structual manner.

See [Roadmap for actionable diagnostics][actionable] for more details. The changes were contributed by [@ckipp01][@ckipp01] in [#7242][7242] and [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] in [bsp#527][bsp527]/[#7251][7251]/[zinc#1186][zinc1186] etc.

### `releaseNotesURL` setting

sbt 1.9.0 adds `releaseNotesURL` setting, which creates `info.releaseNotesUrl` property in the POM file. This will then be used by Scala Steward. See [
Add release notes URLs to your POMs](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/add-release-notes-urls-to-your-poms/6059/1) for details.

This was contributed by Arman Bilge in [lm#410][lm410].
