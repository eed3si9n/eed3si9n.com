My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2162094397">4 of 5 stars</a>

'Ancillary Justice' is written in a first-person narrative as the AI of thousands of years old starship Justice of Toren of The Radchaai Empire. Another interesting part is since the Radchaai language is genderless, the narrator constantly describes everyone as "she," but later you might discover that some character might be <i>he</i>. There are other small details here and there that narrator might say, but you start to question it as the story develops. In other words, Ann Leckie has done a stylish job of show-and-not-tell about the world that she's built.

I've been somewhat skeptical of galactic empire space opera genre, but I must admit I enjoyed reading this book.
