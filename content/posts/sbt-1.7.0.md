Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I am happy to announce sbt 1.7.0. This is the seventh feature release of sbt 1.x, a binary compatible release focusing on new features. sbt 1.x is released under Semantic Versioning, and the plugins are expected to work throughout the 1.x series. Please try it out, and report any issues you might come across.

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.7.0>.

The sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.7.0
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.7.0 is used only for the builds that you want.

### Changes with compatibility implications

- `++` is stricter. See below.
- Drops OkHttp 3.x dependency [lm#399][lm399] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
- Updates to Scala 2.12.16
- Moves domain socket location to `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `/tmp` [#6887][6887] by [@AlonsoM45][@AlonsoM45]
- Deprecates `Resolver.sonatypeRepo` and adds `Resolver.sonatypeOssRepos`, which includes https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/ [lm393][lm393] by [@armanbilge][@armanbilge]

### `++` command updates

Prior to sbt 1.7 `++ <sv> <command1>` filtered subprojects using `crossScalaVersions` having the same ABI suffix as `<sv>`. This behavior was generally not well understood, and also created incorrect result for Scala 3.x since `++ 3.0.1 test` could downgrade subproject that may require 3.1 or above.

sbt 1.7.0 fixes this by requiring `++ <sv> <command1>` so `<sv>` part can be given as a [semantic version selector](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) expression, such as `3.1.x` or `2.13.x`. Note that the expression may match at most one Scala version to switch into. In sbt 1.7.0, a concrete version such as `++ 3.0.1` equires exact version to be present in `crossScalaVersion`.

This contribution was a collaborated effort among [Arnout Engelen](https://github.com/raboof) [#6894][6894], [Rui Gon√ßalves](https://github.com/ruippeixotog) [lm#400][lm400], and [Eugene Yokota](https://github.com/eed3si9n).

### Scala 3 compiler error improvements

In [zinc#1082][zinc1082], [Toshiyuki Takahashi](https://github.com/tototoshi) contributed a fix to ignore `Problem#rendered` passed from the compiler when sbt uses position mapper to transform the position. This is aimed at fixing the error reporting for Play on Scala 3.

In [#6874][6874], [Chris Kipp](https://github.com/ckipp01) extended `xsbti.Problem` to track richer information available in Scala 3. This is aimed at enhancing the compilation errors reported to BSP client such as Metals.

### BSP updates

- Fixes sbt sending cumulative `build/publishDiagnostics` in BSP [#6847][6847]/[#6929][6929] by [@tanishiking][@tanishiking] and [@kpodsiad][@kpodsiad]
- Adds optional framework field to the BSP response [#6830][6830] by [@kpodsiad][@kpodsiad]
- Adds BSP environment request support [#6858][6858] by [@kpodsiad][@kpodsiad]

### setup-java GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions in general includes `sbt`, and the latest [setup-java@v3](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) implements caching support for sbt.

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      with:
        distribution: temurin
        java-version: 8
        cache: sbt
    - name: Build and Test
      run: sbt -v +test
```

This was contributed by [Florian Meriaux](https://github.com/fmeriaux) in [setup-java#302][setupjava302].

### Other updates

- Fixes under-compilation when Java annotation changes by [@SethTisue][@SethTisue] in [zinc#1079][zinc1079]
- Fixes ipcsocket JNI cleanup code deleting empty directories in `/tmp` [ipc#23][ipc23] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

- Fixes watchOnTermination callbacks [#6870][6870] by [@eatkins][@eatkins]
- Fixes `proxyInputStream#available`, which affected sbt-site `previewSite` [#6965][6965] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
