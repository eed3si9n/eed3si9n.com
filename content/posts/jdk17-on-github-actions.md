Here's a quick tutorial of how to test your project on JDK 17 using Ã“laf's [olafurpg/setup-scala][1]. As the starting point we'll use the following setup, which is documented in [Setting up GitHub Actions with sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/GitHub-Actions-with-sbt.html#Build+matrix):

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: 11
            jobtype: 1
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: 11
            jobtype: 2
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: 11
            jobtype: 3
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Setup
      uses: olafurpg/setup-scala@v13
      with:
        java-version: "adopt@1.${{ matrix.java }}"
    - name: Build and test
      run: |
        case ${{ matrix.jobtype }} in
          1)
            sbt -v "mimaReportBinaryIssues; scalafmtCheckAll; +test;"
            ;;
          2)
            sbt -v "scripted actions/*"
            ;;
          3)
            sbt -v "dependency-management/*"
            ;;
          *)
            echo unknown jobtype
            exit 1
        esac
      shell: bash
```

Let's say for `jobtype` 3 we'd like to use JDK 8, and for `jobtype` 1 and 2 we'd like to test on JDK 17. sbt-ci-release uses jabba to grab the JDKs, and at the moment the openjdk 17.0 distros are not available on jabba yet. However, [Eclipse Adoptium fka AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) does have the binary available, so we can use the custom JDK mode to use it as follows:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: "17.0-custom=tgz+https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/download/jdk-17%2B35/OpenJDK17-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17_35.tar.gz"
            jobtype: 1
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: "17.0-custom=tgz+https://github.com/adoptium/temurin17-binaries/releases/download/jdk-17%2B35/OpenJDK17-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_17_35.tar.gz"
            jobtype: 2
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            java: "adopt@1.11"
            jobtype: 3
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Setup
      uses: olafurpg/setup-scala@v13
      with:
        java-version: "{{ matrix.java }}"
    - name: Build and test
      run: |
        case ${{ matrix.jobtype }} in
          1)
            sbt -v "mimaReportBinaryIssues; scalafmtCheckAll; +test;"
            ;;
          2)
            sbt -v "scripted actions/*"
            ;;
          3)
            sbt -v "dependency-management/*"
            ;;
          *)
            echo unknown jobtype
            exit 1
        esac
      shell: bash
```

You should see the following warning if use sbt 1.5.4:

```bash
[info] [launcher] getting org.scala-sbt sbt 1.5.4  (this may take some time)...
[info] [launcher] getting Scala 2.12.14 (for sbt)...
WARNING: A terminally deprecated method in java.lang.System has been called
WARNING: System::setSecurityManager has been called by sbt.TrapExit$ (file:/home/runner/.sbt/boot/scala-2.12.14/org.scala-sbt/sbt/1.5.4/run_2.12-1.5.4.jar)
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of sbt.TrapExit$
WARNING: System::setSecurityManager will be removed in a future release
[info] welcome to sbt 1.5.4 (Eclipse Adoptium Java 17)
```

**Update**:

To add to the confusion, the pre-build binaries are produced by a subproject within Eclipse Adoptium called Eclipse Temurin. As the above banner shows, `java.vendor` says `"Eclipse Adoptium"`. Does that mean that the tar balls are called Eclipse Temurin?
