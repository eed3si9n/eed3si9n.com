Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I'm happy to announce sbt 1.9.1 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.1

See [1.9.0 release note](/sbt-1.9.0) for the details on 1.9.x features.

### Highlights

- Change of contributor license agreement to Scala CLA, which transfers contribution copyrights to the Scala Center, instead of Lightbend by [@julienrf][@julienrf] (Julien Richard-Foy is Technical Director at Scala Center) in [#7306][7306]
- Publishing related bug fixes following up on sbt 1.9.0, contributed by Adrien Piquerez at Scala Center

### Change to Scala CLA

sbt 1.9.1 is the first release of sbt after changing to Scala CLA in [#7306][7306] etc. A number of contributors to sbt voiced concerns about donating our work to Lightbend after 2022, and Lightbend, Scala Center, and I agreed on changing the contributor license agreement such that the copyright would tranfer to Scala Center, a non-profit organization. sbt and its subcompoments, including Zinc, will remain available under Apache v2 license.
