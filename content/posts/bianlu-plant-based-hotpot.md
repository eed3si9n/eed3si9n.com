8. meanwhile, microwave the frozen meatless meatballs.

9. boil hot water separaly, and soak 4 servings (160g) of vermicelli in a bowl or wok for 5 minutes. drain well and add vermicelli to the cabbage. the hot pot is ready to serve.<br>

### how to enjoy bianlu

Serve the stew with meatballs, unseasoned with chili oil and kosher salt on the side.

Add just the salt first and enjoy the cabbage. Don't finish the soup part since it's a constrained resource.

In the second serving onwards, add chili oil and maybe you can even have some of the soup. If the common soup starts to deplete, you should have the national broth reserve that we've set aside. Reheat it and add to the pot.

In the final serving, add some cooked rice (either individually or in the common pot) to make porrige.<br><img src="/recipes/files/bianlu-porrige.jpg"/>
