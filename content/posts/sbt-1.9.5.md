**Update**: ‚ö†Ô∏è sbt 1.9.5 is broken, because it causes Scala compiler to generate wrong class names for anonymous class on lambda. Please refrain from publishing libraries with it while we investigate. See [cala/bug#12868](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12868#issuecomment-1720848704) for details.

Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I'm happy to announce sbt 1.9.5 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.5

See [1.9.0 release note](/sbt-1.9.0) for the details on 1.9.x features.

### Highlights

- Switches to pre-compiled compiler bridge for Scala 2.13.12+ [#7374][7374] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]

### How to upgrade

The sbt version used for your build must be upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.9.5
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.9.5 is used only for the builds that you want.

Download **the official sbt runner** from, `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.5> to upgrade the `sbt` shell script and the launcher.
