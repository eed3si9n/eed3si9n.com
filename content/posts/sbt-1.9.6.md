Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I'm happy to announce sbt 1.9.6 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.6

See [1.9.0 release note](/sbt-1.9.0) for the details on 1.9.x features.

### Highlights

- sbt 1.9.6 reverts "internal representation of class symbol names", which caused Scala compiler to generate wrong anonymous class name by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] in [sbt/zinc#1256](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/1256). See [scala/bug#12868](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12868) for more details.

### How to upgrade

The sbt version used for your build must be upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.9.6
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.9.6 is used only for the builds that you want.

Download **the official sbt runner** from, `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.6> to upgrade the `sbt` shell script and the launcher.

## Zinc regression

We're still investigating on the details, but per Lukas on [scala/bug#12868](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12868):

> Say we have `package p { class C { def m { new anon { def sol } } } }`.
>
> The phase travel `exitingFlatten` added in sbt/zinc#1244 causes the (cached) flatname of `ClassSymbol` for the anonymous class to be computed after the flatten phase. The owner chain of the symbol is different at this point. So instead of something like `p.C$m$anon` we end up with only `p.m$anon`.
>
> The error in Pekko is due to two anonymous classes now having the same name accidentally. However, I believe that this has a broad effect, many anonymous classes will get a different name when compiling with the new zinc.
>
> While it's possibly OK in terms of binary compatibiliy (anonymous classes cannot be referenced externally), it's still an unintended wide-reaching change.
>
> It probably should be considered a bug in the compiler, but we cannot change existing compiler releases. The new Zinc needs to continue working with existing compiler releases.

I merged [sbt/zinc#1244](https://github.com/sbt/zinc/pull/1244) with a cursory review (it looked ok to me), so I take responsibility on this regression. IT'S ME HI.
