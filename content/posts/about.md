I am Eugene Yokota (@eed3si9n on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eed3si9n) and [GitHub](https://github.com/eed3si9n)), a software engineer with years of experience working on Scala tooling. Most recently I was a Staff Engineer at Twitter's EE Build team migrating the largest Scala monorepo into Bazel (See [2 years at Twitter](/2years-at-twitter/) for details).

My specialties are researching and documenting complex landscapes of problems through reading, and talking to people, and bringing them into concrete implementations. I'm great at taking existing tools, and making them more performant and developer-friendly.

I've been lead sbt maintainer since 2014 (as a side project since 2020), former Tech Lead of the Lightbend _Tooling Team_, and [Principal Engineer on the _Scala (Compiler) Team_](/6years-at-lightbend). I'm passionate about improving developer experience on and off the work, and like to tinker with ideas both through coding and this blog <https://eed3si9n.com/> as my personal platform. Here is a selected list of my writing/works:

- [Cached compilation for sbt (2020)](/cached-compilation-for-sbt)
- [Selective functor in sbt (2020)](/selective-functor-in-sbt)
- [Equal protection under Eq law (2020)](/equal-protection-under-eq-law)
- [Making conference a safer space for women (2018)](/making-conference-a-safer-space)
- [Super shell for sbt (2018)](/super-shell-for-sbt/)
- [Unification of sbt shell notation and build.sbt DSL (2017)](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/unification-of-sbt-shell-notation-and-build-sbt-dsl/913)
- [sbt server reboot (2016)](/sbt-server-reboot)
- [Stricter Scala with -Yno-lub (2015)](/stricter-scala-with-ynolub)

See also ['herding cats'](/herding-cats/) series, a tutorial for Typelevel Cats library.

I also have twelve years of experience on various open source projects on GitHub, and eleven years of experience working remotely. Most people would describe me as a friendly person to work with.

### I'm looking for a new team

I'm looking for a new team to solve the next big problem. Beyond my current field of Scala and developer tooling, I'm keen on continuing to be a student of the art. Some of the potential area of interest might be large-scale data processing and bioinformatics.

Location: Remote (my timezone is US East)<br>
Employment type: Full-time employee

Some topics I'll want to discuss with you:

- How robust is the company's business model in a potentially slower economy?
- What is this team most proud of?
- What is the mission of this team? How would it quantify success?
- Where do you think I can do the most good?
- What problems will this team be tackling over the next 6 months?
- Who in this team has given talks at tech conferences like Scala Days?
- Are there any women/Asian/Black/Latinx/LGBTQ person along the management ladder I would report to?
- What's the company's philophy on work/life balance?
- Does this team direclty talk to developers in the community?
- Is it okay if I continued contributing to open source projects in my own time?

I'm looking for the right fit and eager to explore opportunities. Here's my [cv](/cv.pdf). If you think we're a match, please email me at eed3si9n at gmail.com.
