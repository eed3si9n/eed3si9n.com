I am Eugene Yokota (@eed3si9n on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eed3si9n) and [GitHub](https://github.com/eed3si9n)), a software engineer with years of experience working on Scala tooling. I've been lead sbt maintainer since 2014, former Tech Lead of the Lightbend _Tooling Team_, and Principal Engineer on the _Scala (Compiler) Team_ (See [6 years at Lightbend](http://eed3si9n.com/6years-at-lightbend) for details). I'm passionate about improving developer experience on and off the work, and like to tinker with ideas both through coding and this blog http://eed3si9n.com/ as my personal platform. You may have heard of ['herding cats'](http://eed3si9n.com/herding-cats/) series.

My specialties are researching and documenting complex landscapes of problems through reading, and talking to people, and bringing them into concrete implementations. I'm great at taking existing tools, and making them more performant and developer-friendly.

I also have ten years of experience on various open source projects on GitHub, and nine years of experience working remotely. Most people would describe me as a friendly person to work with.
