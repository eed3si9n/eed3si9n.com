Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I'm happy to announce sbt 1.9.2 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.2

See [1.9.0 release note](/sbt-1.9.0) for the details on 1.9.x features.

### Updates

sbt 1.9.2 fixes cross building support `+` and `++` for mixed Scala patch versions.

sbt's stateful cross building has gone though several iterations:

- In sbt 1.0.0 we adopted [sbt-doge](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-doge) implementation, which inverted the ordering of subproject aggregation and Scala version switching to support having different Scala versions within a build.
- sbt-doge implementation was an improvement over sbt 0.13, but it was too lenient on `++`. For example, if a subproject `core` listed `Seq("2.13.11")` in `crossScalaVersions`, it would allow switching to Scala 2.13.1 using `++ 2.13.1`.
- In July, 2022 with [sbt 1.7.0](https://eed3si9n.com/sbt-1.7.0) `++` command became stricter. In addition to `++ 2.13.x` support, `++ 2.13.1` would no longer switch unless the subproject listed `"2.13.1"`.
- In most builds, sbt 1.7.0 behavior would be ok, but there are times where we need to intentionally have two subprojects use _different_ Scala versions. For example, a compiler plugin is published for Scala patch versions that it supports, which can depend on `core` library published one for Scala 2.12.x, 2.13.x, 3.x etc.
- To address this issue, sbt 1.9.2 now allows `++` to fall back to a binary compatible Scala version. For example, `++ 2.13.1` allows `core` subproject to fall back to 2.13.11 because Scala 2.13.x series maintains bidirectional binary compatibility.

This fix was contributed by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n] in [#7328][7328].
