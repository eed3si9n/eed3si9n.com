Hi everyone. On behalf of the sbt project, I am happy to announce sbt 1.8.0-RC1. This is the eighth feature release of sbt 1.x, a binary compatible release focusing on new features. sbt 1.x is released under Semantic Versioning, and the plugins are expected to work throughout the 1.x series. Please try it out, and report any issues you might come across.

### Highlights

sbt 1.8.0 is a small release focused on upgrading scala-xml to 2.x. In theory this breaks the binary compatibility in the plugin ecosystem, but in practice there's already a mixture of both 1.x and 2.x.

If you encounter a conflict in plugins, try putting the following in `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
ThisBuild / libraryDependencySchemes += "org.scala-lang.modules" %% "scala-xml" % VersionScheme.Always
```

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.8.0-RC1> to upgrade the `sbt` shell script and the launcher.

The sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.8.0-RC1
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.8.0-RC1 is used only for the builds that you want.
