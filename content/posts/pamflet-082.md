[Pamflet](http://www.foundweekends.org/pamflet/) is a publishing application for short texts, particularly user documentation of open-source software.

Pamflet 0.8.2 updates its monospace typeface to SFMono, and undoes the incidental pink color that got introduced when I migrated from Blueprint to Bootstrap.
