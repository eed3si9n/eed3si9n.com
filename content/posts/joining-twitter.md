I'm excited to announce that I'm joining Twitter's Build Team to work on the next generation of efficient build systems supporting thousands of Twitter developers worldwide. Today's my first day.

This is the team that developed monorepo build tool [Pants](https://v1.pantsbuild.org/), and is transitioning to migrate the flock to [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). This presented a unique opportunity for me to work with a team of people passionate about developer experience and productivity, and I'm looking forward to getting to know the team, and learning the new challenges.

I would also like to thank everyone who reached out to me during this transition period, often on DM, to check up on me, to stick up for me for an opportunity in their organization, and offering me projects to work on. You kept my spirits high. Thank you! Since my mandatory sabbatical started in [April](http://eed3si9n.com/6years-at-lightbend), I got to work on some of the projects that I previously didn't have time like [build caching](http://eed3si9n.com/cached-compilation-for-sbt) and [Selective functor](http://eed3si9n.com/selective-functor-in-sbt), and got to collaborate with wonderful folks at Scala Center, so it worked out in the end.

EE Build team is still [hiring](https://careers.twitter.com/en/work-for-twitter/202008/3be763f9-9015-4912-9f5d-13a8067c3292/f3560704-245b-4351-9188-3e17b8042e44.html/senior-software-engineer-ee-build-team.html) for "San Francisco, Remote US" location, so if that sounds interesting to you, I'd happy to talk to you.
