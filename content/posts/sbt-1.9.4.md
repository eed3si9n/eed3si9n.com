### How to upgrade

The sbt version used for your build must be upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.9.4
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.9.4 is used only for the builds that you want.

Download **the official sbt runner** from, `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.4> to upgrade the `sbt` shell script and the launcher.

### CVE-2022-46751

[CVE-2022-46751](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jc4-r94c-rp7h) is a security vulnerability discovered in Apache Ivy, but found also in Coursier.

With coordination with Apache Foundation, Adrien Piquerez from Scala Center backported the fix to both our Ivy 2.3 fork and Coursier. sbt 1.9.4 updates them to the fixed versions.
