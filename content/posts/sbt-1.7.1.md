I'm happy to announce sbt 1.7.1 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.7.1

See [1.7.0 release note](/sbt-1.7.0) for the details on 1.7.x features.

### Highlights

- Fixes Java incremental compilation, specifically parsing of annotations in class files of [@SethTisue][@SethTisue] in [zinc#1111][zinc1111]

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner + launcher** from `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.7.1
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.7.1 is used only for the builds that you want.
