### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner + launcher** from `cs setup`, SDKMAN, or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

```bash
sbt.version=1.7.2
```

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.7.2 is used only for the builds that you want.
