I'm happy to announce sbt 1.5.3 patch release is available. Full release note is here - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.5.3

### How to upgrade

Download **the official sbt runner + launcher** from SDKMAN or download from <https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/>.

In addition, the sbt version used for your build is upgraded by putting the following in `project/build.properties`:

<code>
sbt.version=1.5.3
</code>

This mechanism allows that sbt 1.5.3 is used only for the builds that you want.
