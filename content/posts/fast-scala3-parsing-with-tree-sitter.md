Sometime in 2021 I had the pleasure to be on [Chris Kipp][kipp]'s [Tooling Talks][tooling-talks] podcast. One of the questions I prepared is what is tooling. I consider myself a programmer, but I do recognize _tooling people_ in different companies, so there must be something to it. One analogy that I used was that when building a house or an musical instrument, most people are cutting wood etc that would go into the house or the instrument, but there are a few people on the side rigging up something that would make the cut more efficient, by cutting 10 things at the same time, or cutting it easier for the angle specific to the house. They are tooling people.

Maybe because I hang out with other tooling people, for a few years I've been hearing about Tree-sitter, or some Tree-sitter grammar this and that, but didn't get into it until last week.

## what is Tree-sitter?

[Tree-sitter][tree-sitter] is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library, originally announced in 2017 by Max Brunsfeld after 4 years of working on it as a side project, and later as a Github engineer. His [Strange Loop][strangeloop] talk is a great intro to Tree-sitter. In the talk he said that Tree-sitter was used for parsing in Atom and some experimental features in github.com.

To get started, install the Tree-sitter command line tool called `tree-sitter`, which interprets your `grammar.js` to generate a parser code in C. The workflow is reminisent of yacc/bison parser generation that I learned in college.
Compared to performing regex at runtime, which is what more common parsing libraries would do, one advantage of these generator is that they've broken them down into a finite state machine, and parses at fast speed.

A few interesting features of Tree-sitter are that its capable of incremental parsing, and also its capable of parsing code that contains errors. These two aspects make Tree-sitter particularly useful for language features in editors, like syntax highlight and code folding.

Analogous to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), Tree-sitter on its own is unaware of specific programming languages, but once the C code is generated for the language you're interested in, it could be invoked programmatically to annotate the source code with the syntax. One way of thinking about this that `tree-sitter` CLI is capable of turning any source code into LISP. Once the code is in the common format, other people can write common tooling to manipulate it, like highlighting (and more features).

## Neovim, Tree-sitter, and Scala

Vim has a built-in [syntax highlight][vim] feature, mostly based on keyword searches, and while it's searvicable, compared to editors like Sublime Text and VS Code, the highlighting seems less accurate. There's an experimental [Tree-sitter support in Neovim][neovim-doc], which in theory can improve the accuracy. You can follow [nvim-treesitter][nvim-treesitter] to enable hightlighting using Tree-sitter in current Neovim.

When I tried this out last Tuesday, the highlighting for Scala 3's new [optional brace syntax][indentation] was pretty bad. As mentioned, Tree-sitter on its own is unaware of specific programming languages, but there is a separate repo called [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-scala][tree-sitter-scala] that's maintaining the Tree-sitter grammar for Scala, and that seems to not support the new syntax introduced by Scala 3 yet.

Once Tree-sitter can process Scala 3 code, it provides much richer annotation (also known as scopes) of the language, that we can create better syntax highlighting, and other features beyond highlighting using the parsed syntax tree. While this might be a pinacle of the law of triviality -- color of paint to put on the bikeshed -- as a Scala 3 enthusiast on a winter vacation, I felt like this yacc was calling for me.

## conversion from EBNF

Scala 3's syntax is available on [Scala 3 Reference: Scala 3 Syntax Summary][scala-syntax] page as EBNF (extended Backusâ€“Naur form). Ethan Atkins has an abandoned [tree-sitter-ebnf-generator][tree-sitter-ebnf-generator] repo that potentially can convert between the two. I played with it a bit, but I don't think I had the full context of tree-sitter at the time to make it work.

In general, though, while working a transription of a parser it's useful and important to reference the EBNF of the syntax construct.

**Note**: catch<br>
Earlier Scala syntax specification listed case blocks after `catch`. In 2015 <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@som_snytt">Som Snytt (@som_snytt@fosstodon.org)</a> sent a proposal to generalize this in <a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/4400">'Can catch any expression' (scala/scala#4400)</a>. After years of review rounds, it was merged in 2021 as Scala 2.13.6.

## hacking on tree-sitter-scala

Working on [tree-sitter-scala][tree-sitter-scala] is straightforward once you get the hang of it.

```bash
npm install
```

Then make changes to test files in `./corpus`. Then:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

The `tree-sitter` CLI itself is written in Rust. In the above, `npm run build` invokes the CLI, and the code generation is slow for tree-sitter-scala. On my old laptop, the process takes 5 minutes, but depending on the changes I make to the grammar it jumps to 10 ~ 40 minutes or just doesn't seem to end. This means that even when I work on this all day, I can make 10 changes in an hour at best.

To get some idea about the status quo, here's a snippet of Scala 3 syntax code, highlighted using Sonokai theme. Since the theme is Tree-sitter compatible, we can see different elements it tried to color:

![before](/images/ts_sonokai_main_before.png)

Note that `def run` is not highlighted since it doesn't recognize the optional braces syntax.

### optional braces, part 1

Last Tuesday, I sent the first PR ['Optional braces, part 1' (#61)][61], and here's the main change:

```diff
-    template_body: $ => seq(
-      '{',
-      // TODO: self type
-      optional($._block),
-      '}'
+    /*
+     * TemplateBody      ::=  :<<< [SelfType] TemplateStat {semi TemplateStat} >>>
+     */
+    template_body: $ => choice(
+      prec.left(PREC.end_decl, seq(
+        ':',
+        // TODO: self type
+        // TODO: indentation. currently second `val` declaration in the block will
+        // be treated as a top-level declaration instead of belonging to the template.
+        $._block,
+        optional($._end_signifier),
+      )),
+      seq(
+        '{',
+        // TODO: self type
+        optional($._block),
+        '}',
+      ),
     ),
```

`template_body` is the body part of class and object definitions, and this change allows `:` instead of `{ ... }`. It's a small change and it won't parse many things correctly, but we now see that `def run` is recognized as a method:

![main1](/images/ts_sonokai_main1.png)

### optional braces, part 2

In the above, note that `val dealiasedBase` is not correctly hightlighted.
This is because in Scala 2, `val` definition would've required to be inside a `{ ... }` block.
We can certainly make another superficial fix by removing the requirement for `{ ... }`, but generally in Scala 3's optional braces syntax, we need to keep track of the indentation level to know which statement belongs to which construct.

```scala
class A:
  def foo(): Unit =
    val x = 1

    val y = 2
```

In the above, `val y` belongs to `def foo`.

```scala
class A:
  def foo(): Unit =
    val x = 1

  val y = 2
```

In the above, `val y` belongs to `class A`, not `def foo`.

```scala
class A:
  def foo(): Unit =
    val x = 1

val y = 2
```

In the above, `val y` becomes a top-level statement. Since there is a growing interest in this area, it's not surprising that [Anton Sviridov][indoorvivants] looked at it 2 weeks ago, and told me about his [wip][2] branch.

{{% note %}}
**Note**: external scanner<br>
In the Tree-sitter grammar, the terminal tokens are described either with a plain string like `'def'` or by using a regular expression, however there are situations where it's impossible/inconvenient to describe with a regex. There's a feature called <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#external-scanners">external scanner</a>, where you can provide programmatic scanner implementation in C. For example, tree-sitter-scala already uses external scanners to scan string literals, which makes sense since the handling of newline would be different inside `"""..."""`.
{{% /note %}}

What Anton had started in his work-in-progress branch was an implementation of an external scanner for indent/outdent that tracks the indentation level in a stack written in C. I can't remember the last time I've written honest C since using Bison in college compilers course, so this Tree-sitter has a retro future vibe for me.

Using `$._indent` and `$._outdent` I've modified `template_body` and added a new `_indentable_expression` token, which we can use in places like if expression:

```diff
     template_body: $ => choice(
       prec.left(PREC.end_decl, seq(
         ':',
         // TODO: self type
-        // TODO: indentation. currently second `val` declaration in the block will
-        // be treated as a top-level declaration instead of belonging to the template.
+        $._indent,
         $._block,
+        $._outdent,
         optional($._end_signifier),
       )),

....

+    _indentable_expression: $ => choice(
+      $.indented_block,
+      $.expression,
+    ),

     block: $ => seq(
       '{',
       optional($._block),
       '}'
     ),

+    indented_block: $ => seq(
+      $._indent,
+      $._block,
+      $._outdent,
+    ),
```

To test the grammar, `tree-sitter` CLI supports `test` command that takes text files containing both a code snippet and expected S-expression:

```

=======================================
Function definitions (Scala 3 syntax)
=======================================

class A:
  def foo(c: C): Int =
    val x = 1
    val y = 2
    x + y

---

(compilation_unit
  (class_definition
    (identifier)
    (template_body
      (function_definition
        (identifier)
        (parameters
          (parameter (identifier) (type_identifier)))
        (type_identifier)
        (indented_block
          (val_definition (identifier) (integer_literal))
          (val_definition (identifier) (integer_literal))
          (infix_expression (identifier) (operator_identifier) (identifier)))))))
```

In the above, we can see that there are two `val_declaration` nodes, both belonging to `indented_block`. This is why I was saying that `tree-sitter` converts all source code into LISP. Without the indent/dedent tracking, we wouldn't know for sure that `val y` belongs to `def foo`.

### optional braces, part 2.a

One thing I noticed soon is that something like the following code failed to parse:

```scala
class A:
  def foo(): Unit =
    val x = 1

class B
```

Using `tree-sitter` CLI's `parse` command we get:

```bash
$ tree-sitter parse examples/A.scala
(compilation_unit [0, 0] - [5, 0]
  (class_definition [0, 0] - [5, 0]
    name: (identifier [0, 6] - [0, 7])
    body: (template_body [0, 7] - [5, 0]
      (function_definition [1, 2] - [4, 0]
        name: (identifier [1, 6] - [1, 9])
        parameters: (parameters [1, 9] - [1, 11])
        return_type: (type_identifier [1, 13] - [1, 17])
        body: (indented_block [2, 4] - [4, 0]
          (val_definition [2, 4] - [2, 13]
            pattern: (identifier [2, 8] - [2, 9])
            value: (integer_literal [2, 12] - [2, 13]))))
      (ERROR [4, 0] - [4, 7]
        (identifier [4, 0] - [4, 5])
        (identifier [4, 6] - [4, 7])))))
examples/A.scala  0 ms  (ERROR [4, 0] - [4, 7])
```

{{% note %}}
**Note**: robust parsing<br>
Note that even though it failed to parse part of the code (due to parser's limitation), it managed to report majority of the tree, which it did parse instead of failing completely.
{{% /note %}}

An earlier example that I showed actually also fails to parse:

```scala
class A:
  def foo(): Unit =
    val x = 1

val y = 2
```

To explain what's happening let's annotate `INDENT` and `OUTDENT` tokens into the code:

```scala
class A:
  INDENT
  def foo(): Unit =
    INDENT
    val x = 1

OUTDENT
val y = 2
```

The parser is expecting two `OUTDENT`s but instead it encounters `class` or `val`, and it errors.
This is basically a bug in indent/outdent tracking:

```c
bool tree_sitter_scala_external_scanner_scan(void *payload, TSLexer *lexer,
                                             const bool *valid_symbols) {
  // read all the whitespaces and newlines

  if (valid_symbols[OUTDENT] && newline_count > 0 && prev != -1 &&
      indentation_size < prev) {
    popStack(stack);
    lexer->result_symbol = OUTDENT;
    return true;
  }
  ....
```

The scanner is called for each token, and it only return `OUTDENT` when the `indentation_size` decreases after a new line. This one its own is fine, but after the first `OUTDENT`, it will no longer hit the condition. My fix for this was to persist the indent level, and before processing further letters recheck in the beginning of the function if we can `OUTDENT` again:

```c
bool tree_sitter_scala_external_scanner_scan(void *payload, TSLexer *lexer,
                                             const bool *valid_symbols) {
  ScannerStack *stack = (ScannerStack *)payload;
  int prev = peekStack(stack);

  // Before advancing the lexer, check if we can double outdent
  if (valid_symbols[OUTDENT] &&
      (lexer->lookahead == 0 || (
        stack->last_indentation_size != -1 &&
        prev != -1 &&
        stack->last_indentation_size < prev))) {
    popStack(stack);
    lexer->result_symbol = OUTDENT;
    return true;
  }
  stack->last_indentation_size = -1;

  ....
```

We can rebuild the Scala parser, and try again:

```
$ time npm run build && say ok

> tree-sitter-scala@0.19.0 build
> tree-sitter generate && node-gyp build

gyp info it worked if it ends with ok
gyp info using node-gyp@9.0.0

$ tree-sitter parse examples/A.scala
(compilation_unit [0, 0] - [5, 0]
  (class_definition [0, 0] - [4, 0]
    name: (identifier [0, 6] - [0, 7])
    body: (template_body [0, 7] - [4, 0]
      (function_definition [1, 2] - [4, 0]
        name: (identifier [1, 6] - [1, 9])
        parameters: (parameters [1, 9] - [1, 11])
        return_type: (type_identifier [1, 13] - [1, 17])
        body: (indented_block [2, 4] - [4, 0]
          (val_definition [2, 4] - [2, 13]
            pattern: (identifier [2, 8] - [2, 9])
            value: (integer_literal [2, 12] - [2, 13]))))))
  (val_definition [4, 0] - [4, 9]
    pattern: (identifier [4, 4] - [4, 5])
    value: (integer_literal [4, 8] - [4, 9])))
```

This shows that `val y` is now parsed correctly as a child node of `compilation_unit`.

### optional braces, part 2.b

Interestingly the following example also fails to parse for a different reason:

```scala
class A:
  def foo: Int =
    1

  val y = 2
```

Looking at the error, it looks like `val y = 2` fails to be part of `class A`.
This is likely outdent consumes the newline character, but the dection of automatic semicolon is required between the methods and fields within a template:

```javascript
    _block: $ => prec.left(seq(
      sep1($._semicolon, choice(
        $.expression,
        $._definition,
        $._end_marker,
      )),
      optional($._semicolon),
    )),

    _semicolon: $ => choice(
      ';',
      $._automatic_semicolon
    ),
```

Similar to making the scanner persist the last indentation size, we need to persist
the last newline count so the autosemicolon detection regains the newline count.

```c
bool tree_sitter_scala_external_scanner_scan(void *payload, TSLexer *lexer,
                                             const bool *valid_symbols) {
  // read all the whitespaces and newlines

  if (valid_symbols[OUTDENT] &&
      (lexer->lookahead == 0 || (
        newline_count > 0 &&
        prev != -1 &&
        indentation_size < prev))) {
    popStack(stack);
    LOG("    pop\n");
    LOG("    OUTDENT\n");
    lexer->result_symbol = OUTDENT;
    stack->last_indentation_size = indentation_size;
    stack->last_newline_count = newline_count;
    stack->last_column = lexer->get_column(lexer);
    return true;
  }

  // Recover newline_count from the outdent reset
  if (stack->last_newline_count > 0 &&
    lexer->get_column(lexer) == stack->last_column) {
    newline_count += stack->last_newline_count;
  }
  ....
```

Let's try again:

```
$ time npm test

# test passed

$ tree-sitter parse examples/A.scala
(compilation_unit [0, 0] - [5, 0]
  (class_definition [0, 0] - [5, 0]
    name: (identifier [0, 6] - [0, 7])
    body: (template_body [0, 7] - [5, 0]
      (function_definition [1, 2] - [4, 2]
        name: (identifier [1, 6] - [1, 9])
        return_type: (type_identifier [1, 11] - [1, 14])
        body: (indented_block [2, 4] - [4, 2]
          (integer_literal [2, 4] - [2, 5])))
      (val_definition [4, 2] - [4, 11]
        pattern: (identifier [4, 6] - [4, 7])
        value: (integer_literal [4, 10] - [4, 11])))))
```

This shows that `val y` is parsed correctly as part of the class.

### optional braces, part 2.c

Once the basic indent/outdent started working, I added support for control structures,
like `if`, `try`, `match`, `while`, and `for` expression.

Since I am still getting up to speed on writing Tree-sitter grammar, and because each iteration
takes a long time, it's been a series of trial and errors.
Here are some miscellaneous things that I ran into.

#### Tree-sitter vs context free grammer

I am not sure whether this is a specific characteristic of [tree-sitter-scala][tree-sitter-scala]
implementation or if it's a general Tree-sitter issue, but the Tree-sitter grammar is written
slightly differently from a typical BNF that I am used to.

A traditional (E)BNF, like [Scala 3 Syntax][scala-syntax] is written as unambiguous deeply hierarchal tokens as:

```
Expr              ::=  FunParams ('=>' | '?=>') Expr
                    |  HkTypeParamClause '=>' Expr
                    |  Expr1
Expr1             ::=  ['inline'] 'if' '(' Expr ')' {nl} Expr [[semi] 'else' Expr]
                    ....
                    |  PostfixExpr [Ascription]
PostfixExpr       ::=  InfixExpr [id]
InfixExpr         ::=  PrefixExpr
                    |  InfixExpr id [nl] InfixExpr
PrefixExpr        ::=  [PrefixOperator] SimpleExpr
SimpleExpr        ::=  SimpleRef
                    |  Literal
                    |  '_'
                    |  BlockExpr
                    ....
                    |  SimpleExpr ArgumentExprs
```

In comparison, tree-sitter-scala is much flatter.

```
    expression: $ => choice(
      $.if_expression,
      $.match_expression,
      $.try_expression,
      $.call_expression,
      $.assignment_expression,
      $.lambda_expression,
      $.postfix_expression,
      $.ascription_expression,
      $.infix_expression,
      $.prefix_expression,
      ....
      $.generic_function,
    ),
```

This means that Tree-sitter often would run into a conflict where one snippet of code can be
parsed as different meanings. [Conflicting tokens][conflicting] section of the documentation
addresses this. One of the ideas is _lexical precedence_, which is similar to operator precedence but different.

```scala
if 1 < 2 then 3
else 4 + 5
```

It's odd to think this way, but the above code can be parsed in two different ways, which could result to `3` or `8`. The normal way and:

```scala
(if 1 < 2 then 3
else 4) + 5
```

We might intuitively think that infix expression has somewhat low precedence, but it turns out that if expression must have even lower precedence.
Tree-sitter addresses this by assigning `PREC` ordering at the token level:

```javascript
const PREC = {
  control: 1,
  ...
  infix: 6,
  ...
}

    if_expression: $ => prec.right(PREC.control, seq(
      'if',
      ...
    )),

    infix_expression: $ => prec.left(PREC.infix, seq(
      field('left', $.expression),
      ...
    )),
```

Here, the higher number has higher precedence.

Ideally we should introduce more levels so control structure won't be mixed into
lower expressions like `call_expression` and `infix_expression`.
Thus far, my attempt to add more expression layer has increased the build time so much that I can't tell it would complete or not.

#### string tokens

One feature that I didn't fully understand in the beginning, and to be honest
I am not sure if I still do is automatic [keyword extraction][keyword].

Supposedly this feature prevents string with keyword prefix like `yieldSomething` to be interpreted as `yield Something`. What I am not sure is if this prevents `yield` to be interpreted as an identifier.

Take the following code for example:

```scala
def main() =
  if
    val a = false
    a
  then b
  else c
```

Prior to making `if` condition indentable, Tree-sitter happily parsed the above code as follows:

```
$ tree-sitter parse examples/A.scala
(compilation_unit [0, 0] - [6, 0]
  (function_definition [0, 0] - [6, 0]
    name: (identifier [0, 4] - [0, 8])
    parameters: (parameters [0, 8] - [0, 10])
    body: (indented_block [1, 2] - [6, 0]
      (if_expression [1, 2] - [5, 8]
        condition: (assignment_expression [2, 4] - [3, 5]
          left: (postfix_expression [2, 4] - [2, 9]
            (identifier [2, 4] - [2, 7])
            (identifier [2, 8] - [2, 9]))
          right: (postfix_expression [2, 12] - [3, 5]
            (boolean_literal [2, 12] - [2, 17])
            (identifier [3, 4] - [3, 5])))
        consequence: (identifier [4, 7] - [4, 8])
        alternative: (identifier [5, 7] - [5, 8])))))
```

Note that this was parsed as `assignment_expresion` between two `postfix_expression`s. In other words, Tree-sitter parsed `val` as an identifier, which should never happen.

Somewhat related, if we want to not capture `identifier` in `end_marker` etc,
and just reused the regex, Tree-sitter would bucket it up and show a confusing error message:

```
Non-terminal symbol 'identifier' cannot be used as the word token
```

The proper workaround for this is to alias the identifier with a string literal:

```javascript
alias($.identifier, '_end_ident'),
```

### optional braces part 2, the pull request

On Wednesday, I sent ['Optional braces, part 2' (#62)][62], and I've been adding a few commits addressing some of the issues that I described above.

An interesting thing about Neovim's Tree-sitter support is that we can point at
the directory or Github repository on where to grab the generated C code, and
test if the code hightlighting actually improved.

Before:<br>
![before](/images/ts_sonokai_main_before.png)

After:<br>
![main2](/images/ts_sonokai_main2.png)

This is by no means complete support of the new Scala 3 syntax, but I think it's a decent improvement over the status quo.

## Neovim setup to use a tree-sitter-scala fork

Given that some of the pull request has been open since February,
I am not really sure if my PR would be considered anytime soon.

Thankfully [nvim-treesitter][nvim-treesitter] comes with a built-in mechanism to override a grammar to another implementation.
Here's the setup to try this out on your machine.

```
rm -f ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/nvim-treesitter/parser/scala.so
```

#### lua/plugins.lua

```lua
vim.cmd [[packadd packer.nvim]]

return require('packer').startup(function()
  -- Packer can manage itself
  use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'
  use 'tanvirtin/monokai.nvim'
  use 'sainnhe/sonokai'
  use 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
end)
```

#### init.vim

```lua
lua << END
require('plugins')
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup {
  -- A list of parser names, or "all". Don't include "scala" here.
  ensure_installed = { "c", "lua", "rust" },
  sync_install = false,
  auto_install = true,
  highlight = {
    enable = true,
    additional_vim_regex_highlighting = false,
  },
}

local parser_config = require "nvim-treesitter.parsers".get_parser_configs()
parser_config.scala = {
  install_info = {
    -- url can be Git repo or a local directory:
    -- url = "~/work/tree-sitter-scala",
    url = "https://github.com/eed3si9n/tree-sitter-scala.git",
    branch = "fork-integration",
    files = {"src/parser.c", "src/scanner.c"},
    requires_generate_from_grammar = false,
  },
}
END
```

## fast Scala 3 parsing

Let's try parsing some Scala 3 compiler code. Here are some of the largest source file in Scala 3 compiler:

| source                 | lines  | Dotty    |  tree-sitter | speedup |
| ---------------------- | :----: | :------: | :---------: | :-------: |
| `Types.scala`          | `5835` | `1980ms` | `73ms`      | `27x`     |
| `Parsers.scala`        | `3971` | `1854ms` | `40ms`      | `46x`     |
| `ErrorReporting.scala` | `361`  | `1736ms` | `13ms`      | `134x`    |

Even setting aside the absolute speed of tree-sitter, note that increase in 5474 lines results in only additional `60ms`, as opposed to `244ms` in Dotty. This indicates that Dotty parses around `20 sloc/ms` whereas tree-sitter parses `91 sloc/ms`. Granted these parsing still contains partial errors because the grammar doesn't fully support Scala 3 syntax yet, my guess is that it won't increase the parsing speed.

## summary

- [Tree-sitter][tree-sitter] is a language-agnostic parser generator, targeting C language, which is capable of fast, incremental, and robust parsing that permits partial errors in the source code.
- Initially adopted by Atom, Neovim is planning to adopt this to provide richer language features, like syntax highlight and folding.
- Current challenge for Scala is lack of Scala 3 syntax support in [tree-sitter/tree-sitter-scala][tree-sitter-scala], which ['Optional braces, part 2' (#62)][62] and other PRs attempt to improve.
- Neovim can be [setup](#neovim-setup-to-use-a-tree-sitter-scala-fork) to use eed3si9n/tree-sitter-scala#fork-integration branch.
